        <p>
            The Manage Cabbage Mobile application stores all of its data on your device. This means that none of your data is sent to, or stored by us.<br/><br/>

            If you contact us for any reason (such as providing feedback or queries), we will only use your contact information in order to respond. 
            If a response is not required, or after responding we will safely discard your contact information.<br/><br/>

            The only place where your data is sent outside of your device is via the backup functionality. We provide integrations with some third 
            party data storage providers (Such as Google Drive). Using them is entirely optional and requires you to agree to their privacy policies. Backup files are securely 
            encrypted to ensure they are safe on whatever platform they are stored. We also use the minimal possible permissions to ensure we can not 
            access any unecessary data.
